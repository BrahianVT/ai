## Generate the story for our video 
Use chat GPT to generate story first of all you will have to create an account on chat GTP you will have to log in with your email so here in this video I will use three websites and on all these websites you have to create an account there with your email.

There is so many tools to generate images but right now I will use lexica.art to generate images for my videos which is absolutely free you can generate as many images
as you want now what you have to do is come to your story page and  copy it you have to copy one or two lines where sentence has been ending so I have copied it and we
come back here in Lexica Art now we will paste it here and after that we will press the button to generate images so now according to our story our image will be generated.

Now image you like it then download it then according to the next prompt you will get three four similar images which will be we use in our story then similar to that we have to generate and download all images for our story now we have got all images and audio for our story now with these images and audio we have to prepare our video for preparing and editing of our video. 

I am using capcut.com after opening cap cut first here I will take my image which I have just downloaded, after that in the same way we will bring the audio here in our editor we will adjust it here with our images and according to our audio we will make these images equal to your audio

our image is visible here but when our image is changed here there is no transition in it our image is not going to look good in this way so we have to apply transitions between these images now in my editor I go to the transition option here and apply transition on image so in the same way you will apply transitions in the middle of all images.
