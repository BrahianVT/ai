You'll be able to write a description first let's start with profile description with upwork.  

I'm going to go with an upwork profile description chatgpt is one of the most trending topics right now was personal on the 30th of November people's minds are blown away with what you can do it's also breaking record with over 1 million users sign up in just five days but what is exactly chat GPT?.

## What isChat-GPT?
Chat GPT is a chat bot, basically is a chat board built by **open ai** what makes this artificial intelligence so powerful its detailed responses and articulate answers

well check this out if you go to Google and type open ai you can see the first results is [open ai](https://openai.com) so let's go so in the website you go on the top part here that
says introduce chat GTP research release and then sign ups first if you don't have an account it's as easy as adding your email address and confirming that you're not a
robot and password.

The website will ask you to verify your email address they ask you for a name and family name then continue they will ask for a phone number then they will send you a
code to verify the phone number and you're done, now we come to this dashboard the chat GTP dashboard then change to the dark or light mode it's up to you whichever 
you prefer I'm going to use the light mode here now here's the magic.
I'm going to ask chatgpt to write a freelance profile for a copywriter for an upwork platform and see the result:

*I'm a skilled copywriter with a passion for crafting compelling and engaging copy that resonates with your audiences over five years of experience in industry and I*
*specialize in creating high quality content for websites social media email marketing.*
The result is a good profile description that you can use either on upwork or Fiverr or any other platform, I told chatgpt to rewrite this profile but I have no previous experience, how powerful is that but with no previous experience you can do it with AI to write you the perfect description that otherwise you wouldn't be able to write yourself.

Here I said to rewrite and focus on what I bring to the client and don't use I as much it doesn't use I a skill and passionate and committed to delivering high quality
content and engages all and resonates with your target audience my work to your team and add result driven words straight away will give you a different answer you can
take all these responses and edit them add or modify whatever is relevant for your specific case now you know that is still artificial intelligence at its infancy so it
won't give you the exact and accurate information as you like it.

Obviously chat GPT wouldn't know important tips to include in your description like keep it concise, strong action verbs include specific examples of work obviously have to prove and edit your profile description and not just copy it as it is on upwork so I want to test this AI further and see what it gives us I said write a list of 20 writing and the materials I can offer as a freelancer so anyway it says here are 20 writing and copywriting materials that you can offer as a freelancer and spits out 20 options isn't that amazing? 

![list](/assets/img/20-list.png)
You don't need to do research or browse many pages or blog posts or whatever to find these answers now I asked to write a profile description for a copywriter for work and how to do the job for you, now let's move on to writing job proposals you'll be amazed when you see that we're writing a proposal your goal is to convince the client that you are the best person for the job. 

### Right here are some of the tips that you can write winning proposal 
![proposals](/assets/img/winning_proposal.png)

I picked this copyright job post just an example they're looking for a copywriter to create landing pages for specific issues the product solves, the product we're selling is a supplement which can help with inflammation immunity anxiety depression and rainfall we want five landing pages to address each of these issues. 
![proposals](/assets/img/exmaple_work.png)

I asked chatgpt to write a detailed and informative content on a supplement.
![proposals](/assets/img/suplement.png)
nice informative piece of content that you can show the client as part of your writing samples as it is that's just to show the client that you can do the job they ask for now I did the same thing for immunity so then I asked to write about immunity and you see a few seconds of nicely written paragraphs about the subject.

Now if you're not doing copywriting you're doing something else and you need to write proposals just let's go back to the job post you can see you can easily get between 28 and 55 dollars imagine if you can do this job and get that much money and most of the work is done by the AI you can just edit and proofread the work send it off and get paid don't you get accepted or hired by this client.

let's do one more thing and ask chat GPT to write an upward proposal for this job first I wrote the one sentence we are looking for a copyright or to create landing pages for specific issues that our product solves well that's not very specific let's see what it gives us.

![proposals](/assets/img/write_upwork_proposal.png)

I wouldn't advise you to write Dear employer always be more friendly and just say hi and find the name of the but the rest of the proposal is not bad I don't advise you to take the first response or the answer this AI gives you what you should do is guide this AI so it will refine the answer and you get very nicely written proposal in a few seconds so here I said rewrite with more a friendly tone and add what to bring to the recruiter you see straight away it says hi there I hope this message finds you well that's exactly what you should do when you write this kind of proposals on upwork I saw your job posting or copyrighted to create land equations for your product and I'm excited to apply for this position for each job now we have no excuse to do that you can write a proposal that is specific for each person and here are some of the tips that you need to guide the chat GPT to write a great proposal or I should say the proposal that can make the client hire you chat GTP is free at the moment so grab this opportunity use it as much as you can and by
following these steps.
