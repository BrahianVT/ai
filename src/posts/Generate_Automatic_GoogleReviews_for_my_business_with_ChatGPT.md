2. Prompt the AI to say exactly how you want it to respond for example 
> Respond to this Google review do not include an explanation of why or what you see just include the response make a friendly yet professional

**I found the more specific the better**  
3. Now we're going to create a zap to send over the reply we got from our AI directly onto our Google my business account.

And now we're ready to send out some reviews so let's select a bunch of these contacts and now we're going to send them an SMS something like this:

Short and sweet nice and professional and making sure that we have that personalized touch to it by adding this custom value and there we go not too bad 25 reviews in just a few hours everything has been replied to this was all done automatically and every single one of them is a different response.
