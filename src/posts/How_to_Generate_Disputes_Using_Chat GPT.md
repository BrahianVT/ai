# How to Generate Disputes Using Chat GPT

## Access ChatGPT Platform
Hey guys, um, I'm going to show you guys how to generate disputes if you get stuck and you don't know how to, um, basically, you know, write up your own disputes. You can use this resource to generate the dispute for you.
So what I do is I go to Google and I type in chat GPT. I already have an account with them. Once you get to the screen, you'll click here. Um, like I said, I already have an account. If you don't, the account is free for the **GPT 3.5**, but if you want to upgrade for more in-depth stronger letters or stronger responses, you can sign up and upgrade to GPT-4.

## Explain Purpose
I'm just showing you an example of how to write up your dispute letters or have Chat GPT write it up for you.
So all you're going to do is tell it what to do. So you're gonna say, *"Write a dispute letter to the credit reporting agencies about this account, right?"*

So you're going to go to the account on your credit report. You're going to copy it down to the payment history. You're going to go back to Chat GPT. I'm gonna click and paste it.

## Compose the Dispute Message
And you're going to put, "Please dispute inaccuracies and incomplete missing information. Include consumer laws, specifically 15 USC 1681, and demand deletion of this account."

## ChatGPT Response
Once you finish writing that, click enter. As you can see, Chat GPT is writing out the letter for you. So let's go to the top and read the letter.
It says, "Subject: Dispute and request for deletion of inaccurate account information. Dear Sir/Madam, I'm writing this letter to dispute the accuracy of the account information for Capital One as reported by your respective agencies TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax."
So once you copy this letter onto Microsoft, you can edit it to whomever you're going to send it to. So if you're sending it to TransUnion, you're gonna leave TransUnion and delete Experian and Equifax. If you're sending this letter to Experian, you're going to do the same.

You're going to say, **"The letter basically says I have identified several inaccuracies and incomplete missing information related to this account."**
Firstly, I have no knowledge of the Capital One credit card account mentioned in my credit reports. The account indicates a balance of $385, which has been charged off as bad debt and reported by the grantor as a loss.

However, I've never opened, used, or authorized any such credit card account with Capital One. Additionally, the report status of this account is derogatory, and it indicates that the account is in collection.

I have not received any communication from Capital One or any collection agency regarding this account. There has been no attempt made by me or authorized representative on my behalf to settle any outstanding balance with the alleged creditor.

Furthermore, the reported payment history and last activity dates differ across all three credit bureaus, which raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information provided. The reported dates of last activity on this account are inconsistent and do not align with any transactions or activities that I am aware of.

In light of these discrepancies, I am formally requesting a complete and thorough reinvestigation of this account under the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other relevant consumer protection laws, including **15 USC 1681**.

## Correct Inaccuracies
I request that you promptly correct any inaccuracies and delete this account from my credit reports. According to my rights as a consumer under the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct a proper investigation and respond to this dispute.
During this period, I kindly ask that you place this account in dispute status on my credit report to avoid any negative impact on my credit score.
Please provide me with written documentation of your investigation results and the actions taken to rectify the inaccuracies in my credit reports.
If you are unable to verify the legitimacy of this account, I demand its immediate removal from all three credit bureaus.

And close with this letter, please find copies of my identification and so on and so forth.
So basically, Chat GPT, you can use it to write any type of dispute letter. Whatever you tell it to write, you can copy and paste the account in that section, and it will generate the letter for you.

So use this as a tool if you get stuck and don't know how to write a dispute letter. You can use this tool to help you out. Have a good day, guys.
