# How to Use Chat GPT to Write YouTube Scripts for Your Channel
if you 've identified some good keyword topics on that now you can come up with video titles around those topics and then utilize chat GPT to write the entire script for you and obviously write you a good title as well,  I'm going to show you how to do that in this lecture if for example you're not sure how to come up with a topic for YouTube based on specific keywords so let's say you did use tubebuddy's keyword search and you identified that **overweight Americans** is a good keyword for example or **adopt the dog** was a good keyword just as another random example.

what you could do is you could come to chat GPT and literally ask it to suggest you good YouTube ideas based on those keywords so for example if we're going to use overweight Americans you might want to say I'm planning to create a YouTube video and I know that the keyword overweight Americans is a good one to Target to create video around it has a lot of interest and Views but no one is really making videos about it *can you suggest 10 different video ideas and their titles for me to make videos on* about this and then it will literally come up with the ideas for you and suggest them and you can pick the best one or you can pick the best few so the first one is unpacking America's obesity epidemic causes, effects and solutions so once you have the the topic idea and you pick one that you like then we're going going to move on to the next step.

Here which is basically getting it to write the **script** for you and this used to cost you either a lot of time to write the script and do the research yourself or a lot of money because you had to constantly pump out scripts and you'd have to hire somebody on *Fiverr or Upwork* or somewhere else to write the script for you but let's say for example we wanted to take this one like reframing Fitness , simple works for reframing Fitness, simple workouts for overweight beginners you might want to keep in mind that you want to add Americans in there if that was the if if that was the keyword right because overweight Americans would have been a keyword so 
if the title was here you'd want to say like reframing Fitness simple workouts for overweight American beginners so that's an easy way that you can get it to suggest do different topics and different title ideas based on the keywords.

if you find them but let's say right here these are two topics that you've identified that you want to make videos about right so how would you go about having chat GPT suggest the script for you and write it for you right? well what you'd want to do is you want to tell chat GPT **you are now my YouTube script writer write me a** and I have found that five minutes is really a good sweet spot for me because when I Outsource the voiceover it's not that expensive and also it tends to keep viewers attention a lot longer than something like a two minute video or three minute video where you're not really going to get a lot of watch time so the five minute video will keep the attention but it'll also get a decent amount of watch time but it's not like a 20 minute video where nobody's going to want to click on it and nobody's going to think that they have enough time for that so this is just my personal opinion.

Anecdotally based on what works for me I like a **five minute video script** and typically I'll switch this up from like four to five to six minutes but usually it's right around five minutes and that's kind of the scripts I go for so you want to say something along the lines of write me a five minute video script or a 10 minute video script or just write me a video script and see what it comes up with, you can test and play around with it yourself but let's just assume you're gonna say 5 Minute video script I can read on and then you'd put your topic in and the n you'd see what it writes you now every once in a while you'll notice that it does kind of have like different speakers so it would say like you or scene or something like that that's just it coming up with a script just delete those when you go through but obviously you don't want to Outsource this, just copy and paste you're going to want to kind of go through and edit it delete out transition delete out second Point climate and you also don't want to take chat GPT's word for everything right don't just copy and have somebody read out the copy of this because it might not read fluidly make sure you're reading it and proof reading it a little bit and at least making some adjustments to make sure it sounds good.

If we're going to take this we would copy this and we would take it into word and then we'd read it right obviously we would want to take out this we wouldn't need the quotations we take out this take out this take out this take out this oh did not mean to do that take out this take out this and there we go so now we'd read through it because obviously you don't want to send this to your voiceover artist if it doesn't read well or for example if like this is your name because they're literally going to read this is your name based on the script that you give them so read through it once obviously this isn't that long but this probably is like a three to four to five minute video script and just read through and make sure that it sounds good so hello everyone welcome back to our Channel.

I'm and then obviously that would be your name so one thing you'll notice is they aren't the best at writing the hook in the beginning so you might want to adjust this based on your video topic so if I were adjusting this I would want to put something along the lines of the hook so like why your small dog might not be as safe outside as you think I might say like have you ever I might come up with like a stat right here based on how many dogs are attacked outside by specific animals or I might say something along the lines of I'll bet you never thought about all the Predators that lurk outside when your dog is in your backyard and that's going to get somebody's attention right if that's the first sentence and they're a dog owner and they care it's gonna get their attention and then you just adjust this so you'd say something along the lines of today we're gonna cover our furry four-legged friends specifically we're focusing on pint-sized Pals or dogs if you've got a dog that's on the
petite side you've turned it to the right place and I might even delete that out I might start it here where it says we all want the best because realistically the first paragraph or the first few sentences are the most important it's what's going to set the tone for your video and get somebody viewing to either Buy in or not so obviously it's going to do the heavy lifting for us but you still want to adjust different things especially the hook a lot of times so this hook reads a lot better obviously right like I'll bet you've never thought about all the Predators that work outside when your dog is in your backyard we all want the best for our pets ensuring their safety is often our number one priority but today we're going to talk about a few reasons why you're a small dog and then you can read the rest and obviously adjust it I'm not going to waste your time but you can see here like it's coming up with good ideas and it already did the research like the hidden danger of some plants they're Houdini like Escape abilities weather conditions and predators so this would be a pretty solid script that would get a lot of people's attention in my opinion if this was our Niche right and you could do the same exact thing with the American overweight.

you just need to know what prompts to give chat GPT and then let it do its and then let it do the heavy lifting for you now that said this Plug and Play prompt here where it's like you are now my **YouTube scriptwriter** give Chat GPT the identity of your YouTube scriptwriter and tell it exactly what to write about it's going to work in any Niche on ny topic assuming that you obviously have the niche and the topic already and then you give it the prompt but again I want to hit home that you don't just want to copy and paste what it sends you you want to a first and foremost change the hook a little bit so it's better because chat apt doesn't really write the best hooks in my opinion and that's the most important part of your video and then also proofread it just to make sure that there's nothing else in it that doesn't make that much sense.
